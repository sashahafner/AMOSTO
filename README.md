# AMOSTO
[Mass transfer model](https://github.com/sashahafner/AMOSTO/raw/main/AMOSTO.xlsx) for **am**m**o**nia loss from animal slurry **sto**rage

# Summary
[AMOSTO.xlsx](https://github.com/sashahafner/AMOSTO/raw/main/AMOSTO.xlsx) is a spreadsheet implementation of a simple mass transfer model for estimating ammonia volatilization from animal slurry storage structures.
It can be used to calculate emission at a monthly resolution based on climate and slurry characteristics.
The model is described in detail in a paper in Biosystems Engineering:

**Sommer, S.G., Hafner, S.D., Laubach, J., van der Weerden, T.J., Leytem, A.B., Pacholski, A. 2022. Model for calculating ammonia emission from stored animal liquid manure. Biosystems Engineering. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2022.08.007>.**

The latest version of the model (currently v0.5) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/sashahafner/AMOSTO/raw/main/AMOSTO.xlsx) or by clicking the file name above.
