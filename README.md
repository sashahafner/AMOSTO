# AMOSTO
[Mass transfer model](https://github.com/sashahafner/AMOSTO/raw/main/AMOSTO.xlsx) for ammonia loss from animal slurry storage

# Summary
AMOSTO.xlsx is an implementation of a simple spreadsheet model for estimating ammonia volatilization from animal slurry storage structures.
The model is described in detail in a forthcoming paper in Biosystems Engineering:

**Sommer, S.G., Hafner, S.D., Laubach, J., van der Weerden, T.J., Leytem, A.B., Pacholski, A. 2022. Model for calculating ammonia emission from stored animal liquid manure. Biosystems Engineering. doi forthcoming.**

The latest version of the model (currently v0.5) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/sashahafner/AMOSTO/raw/main/AMOSTO.xlsx) or by clicking the file name above.
Send suggestions or report bugs through the [issues page](https://github.com/sashahafner/AMOSTO/issues).
Check back soon (early September 2022) for a link to the paper and the first official model release!
